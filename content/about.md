# Hey I'm Quinn
## Just your average linux-using nerd
I'm a pretty big fan of computers, in all honesty. I love Linux, computer hardware, occasionally I enjoy dabbling around with windows, and I absolutely love gaming. Here you'll find a mix of all of that. This site would be a YouTube channel if it wasn't for me getting interrupted every time I record, but I digress, writing is more fun anyways. Hopefully you enjoy what you find here!
