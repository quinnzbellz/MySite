# This is the Discman D-E201
A while ago I was listening to what at the time was the latest episode the patreon only This Does Not Compute Podcast. The episode was on how CDs were making a return, and how now if you thought a discman might be something you want, it's a good time to pick one up. I went on ebay just for fun to see what I could find, and ended up picking up a Discman D-E201 with ESP2 protection (stops the disc from skipping using a buffer). Overall, this is a solid early 2000's CD player. It runs off 2 AA batteries, has sufficient controls, and features Sony's Megabass feature. Overall, this is a pretty fully featured discman, that I only paid $30 for, and it was fully functional too! Anyone who thinks they might want one of these really should jump on the bandwagon, because I have a feeling they're about to go up in price.
