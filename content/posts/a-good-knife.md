There's no denying the usefulness of a good pocket knife. They make useful fidget toys for when you're bored, they can open boxes, and a ton of other things. An entry level knife can be picked up for around $40, which considering the convenience you're getting, is a really good price. I think that everyone should get a knife, due to how useful they are. Some even have can openers!
