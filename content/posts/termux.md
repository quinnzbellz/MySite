Well first, I should mention that I'm writing this on my phone, and pushing the commit with termux. That shouls give you an idea of how powerful termux is. Termux is basically a terminal emulator for android with package support. It lets you install whatever you want, you could probably even run X.Org on it. Its a neat little tool, so I thought I'd let y'all know about it. It's small apps like this that show where android shines. I personally may start trying to post some things to this blog on the go, now that I've set this up. Anyways, hope y'all have a good rest of your day. Quinn out!
