I installed Windows 11, and know what? I like it! I've been using Linux for a while, but I'm not a FOSS evangelist or anything, nor do I really want to customize my system all that much, and Windows is fine for that. I've been enjoying using WSL2, in fact I'm pushing this post to github from WSL2, and it just works great. Product keys can be found very cheaply online, so that's what I opted to go with, and quite honestly, I don't see myself leaving Windows 11, especially since I can actually play games that don't work on linux such as Call of Duty: Warzone. Anyways, just thought I'd write this because yeah, I do really enjoy Windows 11.
