As of recent, I have fallen in love with the language C. The simplicity of it makes it so easy to work with. Often times, simplicity means less control, but even with nice clean C code, you can have more or less total control over a system. The language is just amazing. There's a reason Mr. Torvalds wrote the linux kernel in C. C, in my opinion, is the ultimate language. While JavaScript does make sense for cross-platform desktop apps target for Windows, Mac, and Linux, C makes sense for the occasional GTK app and works great for console apps on MacOS, Linux, and any other Unix Like Operating systems. What I'm saying, I guess is, I have found my perfect programming language. I will continue to learn C over the next few years, and I hope to be able to master it some day.
