  "articleBody": "The linux community is a gong show in my opinion. On one hand, you’ve got these asshole free software evangelists who happen to be politically far right assholes, and on the other, you’ve got people who’s entire vocabulary is comprised of the words I, Use, Arch, by, the, and way. It really is a shame in some respects, because there are some decent linux communities. I generally find people who use ubuntu don’t care as much about free software, and have much more centered political views. These people aren’t salty about their distro, and typically aren’t fanboys. The gentoo community, while a lot of the people in it fall in line with the political issue, are generally nicer people than those who use ArchLinux. In all honesty, if you say the words, “I use arch BTW” to me, I will generally think a bit less of you for that remark.\nLinux communities are almost like the Call of Duty community in a lot of ways. They’re toxic as hell, and aren’t very welcoming of new players (or users). This can be extremely annoying when there’s a beginner, who doesn’t know quite what to do, and nobody is willing to help. Don’t even get me started on full time Mac users, though. Theyre just as bad if not worse than users of some GNU/Linux distros. While Windows users aren’t perfect, and there is some fanboyism, it’s not nearly as bad because we all have one thing in common: We want our computer to work for us. If one of us needs help, we give it, no questions asked. I find the only people like this in Linux communities are YouTubers, because they want to keep a decent public image of themselves. Even then, you still have some of that going on, with people like Luke Smith, whom I absolutely despise.\nAnother problem with Linux is the people at the forefront of it, no I’m not talking about Linus Torvalds. As far as I’m concerned, while Mr. Torvalds does have some shortcomings, he’s a great guy and pretty down to earth. Who I’m pissed off with is Richard Stallman. Richard Stallman is a disgusting, annoying, incompetent human being, who almost reminds me of Donald Trump in the sense they both act like five year olds. Richard Stallman is crazy in the sense that the man refuses to use any proprietary software, including youtube, google, and others. The man is literally making himself live under a rock, and making life much harder on himself. Richard Stallman has also said some very controversial things regarding rape and underaged sexual intercourse, but I won’t really get into it because it disgusts me even thinking about it.\nTo conclude, I honestly really think the linux community needs work. I’m hopeful that the Valve Steam Deck will do well, and bring Linux to more people, therefore putting a bigger dent into the market, and subduing the toxicity problems linux faces. As with anything, that issue will always remain, but hopefully as Linux gets bigger and bigger, those issues will get smaller and smaller. Quinn Out!\nResources So I figured I should probably back up some of the stuff I said in this mini essay, so here are some sources pointing to what I discussed.\nLuke Smith, a YouTuber I have no respect for, see for yourself Richard Stallman’s Blog Richard Stallman has never installed linux Richard Stallman Rape Controversy Steam Deck Arch BTW was a knock against fedora users\n",
