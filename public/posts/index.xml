      <description>This is the Discman D-E201 A while ago I was listening to what at the time was the latest episode the patreon only This Does Not Compute Podcast. The episode was on how CDs were making a return, and how now if you thought a discman might be something you want, it&amp;rsquo;s a good time to pick one up. I went on ebay just for fun to see what I could find, and ended up picking up a Discman D-E201 with ESP2 protection (stops the disc from skipping using a buffer).</description>

      <description>Hi There! I&amp;rsquo;m Quinn, welcome to my blog. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried this before, and never really stuck with it, mainly because I was pushing just an exported version of my hugo site to github, not the full source. Anyways, I&amp;rsquo;m planning to write some cool stuff on here, so definitely be on the lookout!</description>
